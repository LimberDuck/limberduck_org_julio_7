**LimberDuck** (pronounced ˈlɪm.bɚ dʌk) was initiated on November 26, 2018, with 
the primary objective of developing a suite of free and Open Source [1]_ tools 
tailored for cybersecurity professionals. These tools aim to streamline and 
automate tasks, thereby reducing workload and enabling engineers and managers to 
concentrate on data analysis and strategic decision-making.

Explore **tools** that parse vulnerability assessment [2]_ results, presenting them in clear, 
actionable formats. Review **notebooks** to verify vulnerability [3]_ statistics and create 
your own analyses.
