LimberDuck's main website has been updated with a new look using the `Shibuya <https://shibuya.lepture.com>`_ 
Sphinx template by `Hsiaoming Yang <https://github.com/lepture>`_. 

The landing page is now simple and visually appealing, showcasing LimberDuck tools. All tools' documentations are 
consolidated in one place, eliminating the need to switch between repositories or documentations unless desired.
News updates are now based on `ABlog <https://ablog.readthedocs.io>`_, visit the `News </blog>`_ page to read 
or subscribe in your favorite `RSS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS>`_ reader, such as 
`NetNewsWire <https://netnewswire.com>`_ (a free and open-source RSS reader for Mac, iPhone, and iPad).
