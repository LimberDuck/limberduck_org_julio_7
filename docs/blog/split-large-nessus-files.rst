I'm excited to introduce a new feature in **nessus file reader (NFR) v0.5.0** that will significantly improve your workflow when dealing with large Nessus scan result files. The new ``--split`` option in the ``nfr file`` command allows you to split Nessus files into smaller, more manageable chunks â€” perfect for improving performance during post-processing if your processing tool can't deal with large files.

   Check out the new feature in the documentation: :ref:`nfr-file-split`.

   :ref:`nfr-upgrade` now to **NFR v0.5.0** and start splitting.
