    Open Source
        Generally, Open Source software is software that can be freely accessed, used, changed, 
        and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone. Open source software is made by 
        many people, and distributed under licenses that comply with the 
        `Open Source Definition <https://opensource.org/osd>`_.

    vulnerability
        A vulnerability /ˌvʌlnərəˈbɪləti/ is a weakness in a system that allows a threat source 
        to compromise its security. It can be a software, hardware, procedural, or human 
        weakness that can be exploited. A vulnerability may be a service running on a server, 
        unpatched applications or operating systems, an unrestricted wireless access point, an 
        open port on a firewall, lax physical security that allows anyone to enter a server room, 
        or unenforced password management on servers and workstations.

    Vulnerability Assessment
        A vulnerability assessment identifies a wide range of vulnerabilities in the environment. 
        This is commonly carried out through a scanning tool. The idea is to identify any 
        vulnerabilities that potentially could be used to compromise the security of our systems. 
        By contrast, in a penetration test, the security professional exploits one or more 
        vulnerabilities to prove to the customer (or your boss) that a hacker can actually gain 
        access to company resources.
