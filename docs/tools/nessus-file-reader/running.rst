Running
=======

Once you have **nessus file reader** (``nfr``) installed you can run it in Terminal with command:

   nfr

.. attention::

    Remember to open your Python virtual environment first, if you decided to use it. 
    If you use `virtualenvwrapper <https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io>`_, 
    mentioned in the :doc:`installation` instruction, 
    you can do it with the command ``workon <name_of_your_virtualenvironment>``. 
    To exit your Python virtual environment, use the command ``deactivate``.
